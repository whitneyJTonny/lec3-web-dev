Section A

##List all the primitive data types in JavaScript and give a brief explanation of each.

Number → Represents numerical values (e.g., 42, 3.14).
String → Represents text (e.g., "Hello").
Boolean → Represents true or false.
Null → Represents an intentional absence of value.
Undefined → Represents an unassigned variable.
BigInt → Represents large integers beyond the Number limit.
Symbol → Represents unique identifiers.
 
##What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

null is an assigned value representing "nothing".
undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned  to a value.

##Explain the difference between primitive and reference data types in JavaScript.

Primitive types store values directly (e.g., Number, String).
Reference types store memory references (e.g., Objects, Arrays).

##What is the typeof operator used for? Provide two examples.

Used to check the data type of a variable.
Example:
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof "Hello"); // "string"

##Explain type coercion in JavaScript. Provide an example of implicit type coercion.

Type coercion is JavaScript's automatic conversion of values between types.
Example:
console.log("5" + 5); // Output: "55" (number converted to string)

##What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

== compares values and allows type conversion.
=== compares both values and data types.

##Define and differentiate between mutable and immutable data types in JavaScript, providing one example for each.

Mutable (can be changed): Objects, Arrays. Example:
let arr = [1, 2, 3];  
arr[0] = 10; // Mutates the array  
Immutable (cannot be changed): Strings, Numbers. Example:
let str = "Hello";  
str[0] = "Y"; // No effect, strings are immutable
